Read [1998 Duncan Watts and Steven Strogatz published a paper in Nature, “Collective dynamics of ’small-world’ networks” ](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v393/n6684/abs/393440a0.html) and answer:   
(also [linked from Strogatz's site](https://static.squarespace.com/static/5436e695e4b07f1e91b30155/t/54452561e4b08d9eb2170909/1413817697054/collective-dynamics-of-small-world-networks.pdf) and on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watts_and_Strogatz_model))

1. What process do Watts and Strogatz use to rewire their graphs?  
For every node n<sub>i</sub> in N select edge(n<sub>i</sub>, n<sub>i+1</sub>) and rewire it with probabilty B as edge(n<sub>i</sub>, n<sub>k</sub>) where k is chosen at random and k != i

2. What is the definition of the clustering coefficient C(p)?  
C(p) measures the cliquishness of a typical neighbourhood (a local property).

3. What is the definition of the average path length L(p)?  
Average distance to get from one node to any other.  

4. What real-world graphs did Watts and Strogatz look at? What evidence do they present that these graphs have the same structure as the graphs  generated by their model?  
Film Actors, Power Grids, and the neural network in C. elegans
