This code runs well with python 2.7  - it's not 3 compatible.  
I set up my environment with Conda, which you're probably already using, you can install and use another version easily ...  

To create a new python 2.7 enviorment named `python2`:  
`conda create --name python2 python=2.7`   
then to activate it (on UNIX): `source activate python2`
It's that easy! 

See their Documentation for more [https://conda.io/docs/py2or3.html](https://conda.io/docs/py2or3.html)  

I may have started answering some of the excercises :hankey: in the main folder, most of the code in `./code` was provided by Mr. Downey himself though
