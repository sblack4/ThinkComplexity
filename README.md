runs well with python 2.7  (you need python 2 though)  
with conda (which you're probably already using) you can install and use another version easily [https://conda.io/docs/py2or3.html](https://conda.io/docs/py2or3.html)  
to create a new python 2.7 enviorment named `python2`:  
`conda create --name python2 python=2.7`   
then to activate it (on UNIX): `conda source activate python2`
